Helmet is a neo-grotesque display typeface, inspired by Swiss classics like Helvetica and Univers. The typeface plays with vertical and horizontal proportions to create a unique look, which suits both large and small text. Licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Helmet is free both for personal and commercial use.

Helmet Neue is a new and refined version of the typeface, with cleaner glyph quality and an expanded character set. This version also includes a set of tabular and a set of old-style figures. The tabular figures can be enabled in CSS with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` and the old-style figures with `font-variant-numeric: oldstyle-nums`.
